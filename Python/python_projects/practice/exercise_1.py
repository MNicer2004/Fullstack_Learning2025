ğŸ§  Problem 1: Even or Odd Checker
Description:
Write a Python program that:

Asks the user to enter a number.

Checks whether the number is even or odd.

Prints a message saying whether it's even or odd.
'''
'''
user = int(input("Enter a number from 1 to 10: "))

if user in (2, 4, 6, 8, 10):       # Checks if user is one of these even numbers
    print("Even")
elif user in (1, 3, 5, 7, 9):     # Checks if user is one of these odd numbers
    print("Odd")
else:                             # If user is not in 1â€“10
    print("Enter a number from 1-10 only.")
''' '''
#much better way
user = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if user % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
'''
'''
ğŸ§© Problem 2: Number Range Checker
Ask the user to enter a number.

If the number is less than 1, print "Too low!"

If the number is greater than 10, print "Too high!"

If the number is between 1 and 10, print "Just right!"
'''
'''
number = (int(input("Please enter a number: ")))

if (number < 1):
    print("Too Low!")
elif (number > 10):
    print("Too High!")
elif (number >=1 and number <=10):
    print("Just right!")          
'''
'''
ğŸ§© Problem: Grade Checker
Ask the user to enter a test score (from 0 to 100).

Then print the grade:

90 to 100 â†’ "Grade: A"

80 to 89 â†’ "Grade: B"

70 to 79 â†’ "Grade: C"

60 to 69 â†’ "Grade: D"

0 to 59 â†’ "Grade: F"

If the number is not between 0 and 100, print "Invalid score."
'''
'''
