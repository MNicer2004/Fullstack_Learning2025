## 📚 What's Inside

You'll find folders and files organized by language and topic:

- `python/` – Python practice files (e.g. `day1.py`, `day2.py`)
- `html/` – HTML basics and layout practice
- `css/` – Styling exercises and responsive design
- `js/` – JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation

More folders will be added as I explore new technologies and full stack projects.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a solid foundation in full stack development by practicing daily and documenting my progress.
